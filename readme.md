# 🧠 RL Training Framework for High-Frequency Trading

This library provides a complete reinforcement learning (RL) framework for training agents in high-frequency trading (HFT) environments.

## 🚀 Overview

This framework is designed to help you:

Define and train RL agents in HFT contexts

Use real tick data for realistic simulations

Experiment with market-making strategies

⚠️ Note: This framework requires a compatible HFT simulation environment.

## 🔗 Related Projects

📂 Example Training Workflows

You can find usage examples in the tests/ directory.Specifically, look into the folder:

tests/mm_mt5_maj/

There, you’ll find examples of training a market-making agent using tick-level data.

## 🛠️ Dependencies

Ray RLlib v2.43.0 — the main RL library used in this framework.
